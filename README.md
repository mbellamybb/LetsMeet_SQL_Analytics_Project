# Background
**What is LetsMeet?**

LetsMeet is an online network for professionals and enthusiasts to meet up in real life with groups that share common interests.

**Where is LetsMeet?**

LetsMeet currently operates in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, with plans to expand across the United States.

**What is my role at LetsMeet?**

LetsMeet has hired me on a temporary contract as a Data Analyst to support the growth LetsMeet has been experiencing in the past six months by providing insights into who LetsMeet members are and how they use the platform.

# The Data

The LetsMeet data exists on a SQL Database.

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The tables in the LetsMeet SQL Database are:

**grp**

The core part of LetsMeet are the groups. The grp table contains information about the groups
that use LetsMeet to network. Our groups cover a huge range of topics such as animal rights,
backgammon, kayaking, and dachshund.

Columns: group_id, category_id, city_id, created, description, join_mode, group_name, rating,

**grp_member** 

Group members that makeup groups

The grp_member table contains data on individual members. Each row lists one member and one
group. So members in multiple groups appear multiple times. Most members are based in the
New York, Chicago, and San Francisco areas, but they come from all over the world.
Columns: member_id, city, country, hometown, joined, member_name, member_status, visited,
group_id.

# Part 3 - Database Normalization

Normalization was carried out including the modification of tables by eliminating redundant or uninformative columns while preserving information. A strategy was developed to split tables to save storage space and time. Reverse engineering of the Entity Relationship Diagram was carried out to visualize the new database structure.
